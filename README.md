# IDElessAVR - Flyandance Advanced 8-bit AVR compile and Upload batch Program Universal
IDE is for dummy, and Atmel studio is really a bloatware. Instead of creating an alternative that probably would turn into bloatware, a no-string-attached, a no-IDE, an ideless approach has been invented.

The core is the toolchain that turns source code into machine code. ZFDxAVR_ideless 2.0 is a powerful script program that scans the whole project folder and sub-folder for valid source code, compiles them and then upload final executable and it works very well. Version 2.0 combines all my old scripts into one universal one, and most importantly it's been well commented that anyone with some competent should be able to modify the script easily without much knowledge on the ancient art of the batch programming language.

+ Alternative to IDE or more precisely to makefile 
+ One click automatation script with extra options
+ Scan working folder and Compile all .c .cpp .s .o files to .elf .lss .hex file
+ Fast, simple and works
+ Auto-upload via AVRdude
   
C is a simple yet extremely complicated programming language; Compiling a simple program is simple, but for advanced exploitations, you really need to dig in and hack the fout of the compiler. This script lets you type in more compilation options, and there are literally thousands of options, and GNU complier manual is 1111+ page long, thus this is absolutely not for dummies or for someone whom doesn't want to learn and be less dumber every day. 

To support the creation of more quality code, do donate whatever amount that you are comfortable with. I have worked so hard on this, and if hard works are not rewarded, who would work as hard?
